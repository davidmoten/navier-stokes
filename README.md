navier-stokes
=============

Scala code to model water movement using the Navier-Stokes incompressible fluid equations.

*Status*: pre-alpha

##Purpose: 

Provide a clear and concise solver for the Navier Stokes equations over a rectangular grid domain (regularly gridded) for an incompressible liquid (sea water). 

Concise and clear code is considered more important than performance because concurrent/distributed running of the routines will be used to provide performance scalability.
